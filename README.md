===

Meet **circ**, our channel locked Ultimate IRC Bot. After recently deprecating
vini, we decided to up the ante: to forge our own bot from scratch. No forking,
no outside code, but this time we can't leave #gnulag. All leading up to
eventually taking on one of IRC's biggest challenges, the agreeing on
something.
